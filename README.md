# Nexcent Figma-to-Liferay FE–BE Project

Build the Nexcent landing page from the supplied Figma design on **Liferay DXP 2026.Q1.1 LTS**. This is a coordinated frontend/backend delivery project, not a general Liferay platform course.

The Figma landing page and its detailed Style Guide are the source of truth. Every visible component is analyzed from both views:

- **FE:** rendering, responsive behavior, accessibility, component states, and Liferay frontend technology.
- **BE:** content ownership, Web Content fields, assets, API contract, validation, migration, and editor workflow.

The previous course is preserved at [`archive/course-v1`](https://github.com/hungtvb/liferay-mini/tree/archive/course-v1).

## Original project scope

### Frontend

- Extract the Figma Style Guide and implement it with one unified Nexcent Theme client-extension project.
- Provide Theme CSS, frontend tokens, the `Nexcent Default` Style Book package, Global CSS, Global JavaScript, and a theme favicon.
- Build at least three complete dynamic components using Custom Element Client Extensions.
- Build one externally hosted Community Updates Remote App and register it in Liferay.
- Do not hard-code text, images, services, statistics, testimonials, or blog cards in frontend source.
- Consume Liferay Headless APIs.
- Implement desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts with loading, empty, and error states.

### Backend

- Model the complete landing page with Classic Web Content Structures and FreeMarker preview Templates.
- Include Text, Image, Boolean, Number, Select, and HTML/Rich Text fields where appropriate.
- Manage assets in Documents and Media.
- Define stable field references and external reference codes as the FE–BE contract.
- Provide the Excel migration contract and browser importer flow.
- Package repeatable data with a real Batch Client Extension and verify Headless Batch Engine export/import behavior.
- Imported records must appear under **Site Content → Web Content** without duplicate ERCs or migration errors.

## Explicit non-goals

The core project does not require OSGi business modules, Gogo Shell, Service Builder, REST Builder BFF, or legacy Liferay Forms. Those technologies are added only when a business requirement needs them.

## Theme package

The shared design foundation is maintained in:

```text
client-extensions/nexcent-theme/
├── client-extension.yaml
├── package.json
├── assets/
│   ├── favicon.svg
│   ├── global.css
│   └── global.js
├── src/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── _clay_variables.scss
│   │   └── _custom.scss
│   └── frontend-token-definition.json
└── style-book/nexcent-default/
    ├── frontend-tokens-values.json
    └── style-book.json
```

One `client-extension.yaml` defines four entries:

- `nexcent-theme-css`
- `nexcent-global-css`
- `nexcent-global-js`
- `nexcent-theme-favicon`

The Style Book is a Liferay site configuration bound to the Theme CSS external reference code. Its import files are versioned beside the client extension so DEV, STG, and PROD use the same approved defaults.

## Component delivery map

## Project acceptance criteria

- The implemented page matches the Figma composition and detailed Style Guide.
- The unified Theme package deploys Theme CSS, Global CSS, Global JavaScript, and the favicon together.
- `Nexcent Default` Style Book values map one-to-one to the Theme CSS frontend tokens.
- Style Book changes propagate through stable Global CSS aliases.
- Header, Footer, Navigation, and Newsletter use Liferay OOTB page-building capabilities.
- Hero, Services, and Features are complete dynamic Custom Elements.
- Community Updates runs as an externally hosted Remote App registered in Liferay.
- No sample business content is hard-coded in TypeScript, JSX, or CSS.
- All landing-page content can be edited or migrated through Liferay.
- Excel import creates or updates records by ERC and does not create duplicates.
- Batch deployment is repeatable and uses a Batch Engine-generated `jsont` contract.
- Desktop, tablet, mobile, keyboard, loading, empty, and error states are demonstrated.
- FE and BE evidence is recorded in [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md).

## Branches

- `main`: reviewed rebuilt project.
- `final`: verified reference implementation after the rebuilt course is complete.
- `archive/course-v1`: preserved previous course before the scope reset.

## Rules

- Do not commit `bundles/`, credentials, tokens, or machine-specific paths.
- Do not use numeric environment IDs as frontend configuration.
- Use explicit field references and stable ERC conventions.
- Do not invent Batch Engine configuration blocks; export them from the running target version.
- Do not introduce unrelated Liferay technologies merely to expand the syllabus.
